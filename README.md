# Unlock the Power of Word Embeddings

Welcome to the Word2Vec implementation repository! Here, we delve into the fascinating world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by constructing Word2Vec from the ground up. Whether you're a novice in NLP or an enthusiast looking to deepen your understanding of word embeddings, this repository is your gateway to insightful exploration and practical hands-on experience.

## Understanding Word2Vec

Word2Vec is not just a tool; it's a language transformer. By converting words into numerical vectors, it empowers machine learning and deep learning models to comprehend and process textual data efficiently.

### Two Paths to Embeddings

1. **Frequency-Based Embeddings**: From Bag of Words (BoW) to TF-IDF, we dissect the essence of words based on their occurrences and importance within a document or corpus.

2. **Prediction-Based Embeddings**: Word2Vec stands tall here, predicting words based on their contextual surroundings, capturing nuanced semantic meanings and sentiments.

## Unveiling Word2Vec's Magic

Word2Vec operates through two fundamental architectures:

1. **Continuous Bag of Words (CBoW)**: Anticipating the target word from its context words, it's like deciphering the unsaid from the said.

2. **Skip-Gram**: Fathoming context words from the given target word, akin to unveiling the hidden clues in a message.

In this repository, we illuminate the path of CBoW, shedding light on its intricacies and implementations.

### Crafting the Implementation

1. **Data Crafting**: Employing the sliding window algorithm to curate training data with target words and their contextual companions.

2. **Neural Network Design**: We craft a neural network, a digital maestro, with a single fully connected layer to orchestrate the word prediction symphony.

3. **Training Grounds**: Weights are fine-tuned using the melody of Backpropagation, harmonizing our model for optimal embeddings.

## Embrace the Possibilities

- CBoW dances gracefully with smaller datasets, rendering swift and precise results.
- Skip-Gram, with its broad strokes, paints vivid semantic landscapes on larger canvases of data.
